This branch is for testing the coreos-koji-tagger in Fedora Infra
stage. The branch just contains the manifest lock files. The lock
files need to contain rpms that are available in the staging koji
which are often very far behind production, so the rpms will probably
be rather old.

See
[the coreos-koji-tagger docs](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-releng-automation/tree/master/coreos-koji-tagger#testing-in-fedora-stage)
for more information.
